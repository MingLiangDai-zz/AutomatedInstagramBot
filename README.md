# Automated Instagram Bot
**Description:**
This is a script coded in Python that automatically unfollows the individuals that the user follows and yet do not follow the user back. This is a script that uses Selenium, a framework used for testing web applications, and the ChromeDriver web driver. With these two tools, the script is able to automatically log on to the user’s Instagram account, given the user’s log-in credentials, and read through the user’s followers list and following list to identify Instagram users that do not follow the user back. After the reading is complete, the script automatically goes through the list of individuals who do not follow back and unfollows them. 

**Instructions:**
Enter your Instagram log-in credentials into the variables at the top of the app.py file.
